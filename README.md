# JSDB (JSON Style DataBase)
JSDB is a free and opensource NoSQL databases that uses files on the system. Its easy to use, it follows JSON style of storing data and allows the developer a fully customizable encryption. 

## How is it different from other DataBases?
 
JSDB allows the complete control in the hands of the developer including deciding the encryption type, key and iv. JSDB also allows store data as files and developer can decide where the file will be stored in the host system. JSDB comes in with built in functions to access the databases and doesnt use SQL. Since this is in JSON formatting a user will not need to worry about accedentally writing a value to the database with a wrong key, ast it won't break the database or the code. JSDB also have basic functions as to prevent any injections from the database, and gives full customization of the main file to the developer. Visual controls through site is not possible hence controling the database is only in the developer's hand, if the developer requires visual control, developer can make a personal visual database control.

## How to use JSDB

To use JSDB on hast to just add the jsdb-conn.php file in the host server, create a new jsdb object in the files using jsdb. User can store database file anywhere in the host server with the filetypr .jsdb and use the functions to call the database. 

To jsdb-conn.php files with different names can be used, with different encryption values, thus providing 2 databases in the site with completely different encryption types.
